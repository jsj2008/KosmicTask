This folder contains the source and executable for [JavaScript Lint](http://www.javascriptlint.com/).

JavaScript Lint holds an advantage over competing lints because it is based on the JavaScript engine for the Firefox browser. This provides a robust framework that can not only check JavaScript syntax but also examine the coding techniques used in the script and warn against questionable practices.

Also note the existence of [JSLint](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint)
