 \
"cint" is a C/C++ interpreter which has following features.\
\
 * Support K&R-C, ANSI-C, ANSI-C++\
    Cint has 80-90% coverage on K&R-C, ANSI-C and C++ language constructs. \
   (Multiple inheritance, virtual function, function overloading, operator \
   overloading, default parameter, template, etc..)  Cint is solid enough \
   to interpret its own source code. \
    Cint is not aimed to be a 100% ANSI/ISO compliant C++ language processor.\
   It rather is a portable script language environment which is close enough \
   to the standard C++.\
\
 * Handling Huge C/C++ source code\
    Cint can handle huge C/C++ source code. This has been a problem for other\
   C++ interpreter. Cint is quick in loading source files. Cint can interpret\
   its own over 60,000 lines source code.\
\
 * Interpretation & Native Code Execution can be mixed\
    Depending on speed and interactiveness requirement, you can mix Native\
   Code execution and interpretation. "makecint" makes it possible to \
   encapsulate arbitrary C/C++ object as a precompiled library. Precompiled\
   library can be configured as a Dynamic Link Library. Access between\
   interpreted code and precompiled code can be done seamlessly in both\
   direction. \
\
 * Single-Language solution\
    Cint/makecint is a Single-Language environment. It works with any \
   ANSI-C/C++ compiler to provide the interpreter environment on top of it.\
\
 * Bridge between serious programmers and other professionals\
    Cint is meant to be a bridging tool between software and non-software\
   professionals. C++ looks rather easy under the interpreter environment.\
   It helps non-software professionals to talk in the same language to\
   their software counterpart. Today's System-On-Silicon evolution demands\
   integration and standardization of design tools in software, hardware, IC\
   and system design processes. Cint is a key enabling technology to this\
   critical issue.\
\
 * Dynamic C++\
    Cint is dynamic. It can process C++ statements from command line,\
   dynamically define/erase class definition and functions, load/unload \
   source files and Dynamic Link Library.  Extended Run Time Type \
   Identification mechanism is provided. This will allow you to explore\
   unthinkable way of using C++.\
\
 * Built-in Debugger, class browser\
    Cint has a built-in debugger with an extensive capability to debug\
   complex C++ execution flow. Text base class browser is a part of the \
   debugger capability.\
\
 * Portability\
    CINT works on number of Operating Systems.\
   HP-UX, Linux, SunOS, Solaris, AIX, Alpha-OSF, IRIX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, \
   NEC EWS4800, NewsOS, BeBox, Windows-NT ,Windows-9x, MS-DOS, MacOS, VMS,\
   NextStep, Convex. Porting should be easy. Refer to platform/README. \
   What about OS2, VxWorks, etc...?\
\
 * CINT users spread world wide\
    Many people world-wide are using Cint. Many C/C++ libraries have \
   been encapsulated. CERN and Fermi-Lab choose Cint as front-end command \
   processor and script interpreter for "ROOT" Object Oriented Software \
   Framework. The ROOT/CINT framework will be used in Large Hadron \
   Collider(LHC) research project beyond 2020.\
\
 * More applications\
   We have done, so far, following integration.\
   ROOT/CINT framework: Next generation C++ Object Oriented Framework\
   WildC++ interpreter: CINT + Tcl/Tk \
   CINTOCX            : CINT + VisualBasic\
\
   There are unlimited opportunity of CINT integration. To list up a few,\
   Cint3D             : CINT, openGL, DirectModel, VRML integration for 3D\
   VeriCint           : CINT + Verilog-XL simulator connected by PLI and TCP/IP\
   MathCint           : CINT + Math library + Digital Filter Design tool, etc\
   CintSQL            : CINT + Database connection\
   CintWin32          : CINT + Win32 API\
   Your contribution will be greatly appreciated.}
