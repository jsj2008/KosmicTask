Building prepares a task for execution.

For interpreted languages a build usually equates to some form of syntax check or static analysis.
For compiled languages a build equates to compilation, whether that be to native code or an intermediate format.

Some interpreted languages may have no syntax check capability and thus no distinct build stage.

If the language does not support this feature then all KosmicTask results must be passed as strings.

However, KosmicTask can interpret results formatted using YAML. The use of YAML, although more cumbersome than using a Cocoa bridge, allows structured results to be returned. These results can also be appropriately formatted and transformed. In some cases built in support may be available for translating between native types and their equivalent YAML representation.

If the language does not support this feature YAML representations can still be returned as results but the YAML representation will have to be explicitly constructed.
