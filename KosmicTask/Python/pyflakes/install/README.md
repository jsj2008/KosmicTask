#pyflakes

[pyflakes](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes) is program to analyze Python programs and detect various errors. It works by parsing the source file, not importing it, so it is safe to use on modules with side effects. It's also much faster.

The pyflakes folder is copied into the php language plugin bundle.
