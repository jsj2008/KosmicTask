[Spyc](http://code.google.com/p/spyc/) is a YAML loader/dumper written in pure PHP. 

Given a YAML document, Spyc will return an array which you can use however you see fit. Given an array, Spyc will return a string which contains a YAML document built from your data.

The spyc folder is installed by the php language plugin bundle.

Note that there are [other php modules](http://pecl.php.net/package-search.php?pkg_name=yaml&bool=AND&submit=Search) that may offer better performance via libyaml. spyc is a pure php implementation.
