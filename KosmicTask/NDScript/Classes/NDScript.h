	@abstract Cocoa wrapper classes for AppleScripts
	@discussion The <i><tt>NDScript</tt></i> class are a set of class to provide Objective-C access to AppleScripts, it provides much more functionality than Apples own NSAppleScript and my previous NDAppleScriptObject. There are four main classes within NDScript, NDScriptData, NDScriptHandler, NDScriptContext and NDComponentInstance.
	<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><tt><b>NDScriptData</b></tt></td>
				<td><tt>NDScriptData</tt> is the base class fo all script data, direct instances of NDScriptData represent simple data like numbers, strings, list and records</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				 <td><tt><b>NDScriptHandler</b></tt></td>
				 <td><tt>NDScriptHandler</tt> represents a script proceedure content, it does not have a context and so needs to be executed with a context to be executed</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				<td><tt><b>NDScriptContext</b></tt></td>
				<td>A script context represent everyting people normally associate with an AppleScript, it can contain handlers and properties. <tt>NDScriptContext</tt> is the class you use in place of NSAppleScript of NDAppleScriptObject</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><tt><b>NDComponentInstance</b></tt></td>
				<td>This class represents a connection to a scripting component, for <tt>NDScriptData</tt> objects to be used together they have to use the same connection to the scripting component ie the same <tt>NDComponentInstance</tt>, though if one <tt>NDScriptData</tt> object is passed to another <tt>NDScriptData</tt> that has a different <tt>NDComponentInstance</tt> then the <tt>NDScriptData</tt> object is copied into the same <tt>NDComponentInstance</tt> and the copy is used instead.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
